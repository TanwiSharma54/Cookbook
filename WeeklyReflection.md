Weekly Reflection
Original note: Document how your week in Ent Java went. You may use whatever format suits you, as long as you share how much time you worked and provide a general overview of how things went: achievements and struggles.

Week 1
9/4/2019 - 5.5 hours

Tasks Completed:

Chose a project goal
Reviewed numerous APIs for suitability
During the first week I was more focused on watching the Week 1 videos and getting my laptop set up for class, and so I did not spend a lot of time on the Independent Project. During the first class session, I got a good feel for what will be expected for this project. Based on that, I decided that my project should revolve around one of my outside interests, particularly travel or photography (or both).

I then spent time reviewing numerous API websites to find a suitable candidate for my project. I did not have any luck locating exactly what I was looking for. This is exactly what happens any time I go shopping for one specific thing. I didn't find any particular API that sang to me.

Week 2
9/11/2019 - 9.5 hours

Tasks Completed:

Reviewed APIs on ProgrammableWeb.com
Created this repository
Drafted my problem statement
During the second class session, I was pointed to ProgrammableWeb as a good source of APIs. I then spent some time searching through it looking for candidate APIs. None had jumped out at me before we met for class the next time. Using the example from the FatBikeTrailReport sample, I began drafting my problem statement.

Week 3
9/18/2016 - 12 hours

Tasks Completed:

Selected API from ProgrammableWeb listings
Completed my problem statement
Drafted my user stories
Wrote out my project plan, which may be modified as needed
Began this weekly reflection document
Write out designs for my screens in text form
Week 4
9/25/2019 - 8 hours

Tasks Completed:

Reviewed additional APIs on ProgrammableWeb.com
Updated design document
Began working on Java Classes
This week I took a deeper dive on my Project Plan and associated design documents. I mapped out in more detail what each Java Class would need, the specifics of the database tables, and each of the JSPs. I began to code the Java Classes, but did not proceed too far; I focused on the weekly exercise which would be helpful when coding my project.

Week 5
10/2/2019 - 6.5 hours

Tasks Completed:

Coded two Java classes
Set up initial MySQL database with three tables
Coded Hibernate configuration
This week I worked mainly on the second Hibernate exercise; since Hibernate is so important for this project I wanted to be sure I had a good understanding of it before I got too far along on this project. Once I had that exercise completed I began setting up the configuration within my independent project.

Week 6
10/9/2019 - 15 hours

Tasks Completed:

Coded two more Java classes
Tested with my test database
Things are starting to shape up. The exercise for Week 5 was immensely helpful. I am setting up more classes and hope to begin working on DAOs prior to Wednesday evening.

Week 7
10/16/2019 - 25 hours

Tasks Completed:

Coded three DAOs (not using a generic one at this time)
Coded two TestDAOs and ran them
Tested with my test database
It was a big success to get the TestDAOs actually running. One setback was that when I created my project, the folders were not marked as Sourve, TestSource, etc. But a quick Google search helped me get that straightened out, and it only took a matter of minutes/clicks and I was able to run my first tests.
